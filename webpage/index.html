<h2>Input Device</h2>
<p>In computing, an input device is a piece of equipment used to provide data and control signals to an information processing system such as a computer or information appliance. Examples of input devices include keyboards, mouse, scanners, cameras, joysticks, and microphones. </p> <a name="back to top"></a>

<a name="outputdevice"></a>
<h2>Output Device</h2>

<p>An output device is any piece of computer hardware equipment which converts information into human readable form. It can be text, graphics, tactile, audio, and video. Some of the output devices are Visual Display Units (VDU) i.e. a Monitor, Printer graphic Output devices, Plotters, Speakers etc.</p>

<a name="centralprocessingunit"></a>
<h2>Central Processing Unit (CPU)</h2>

<p>A central processing unit (CPU), also called a central processor, main processor or just processor, is the electronic circuitry that executes instructions comprising a computer program. The CPU performs basic arithmetic, logic, controlling, and input/output (I/O) operations specified by the instructions in the program.</p>


<a name="arithmeticlogicunit"></a>
<h2>Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)</h2>

<p>In computing, an arithmetic logic unit (ALU) is a combinational digital circuit that performs arithmetic and bitwise operations on integer binary numbers.</p>


<a name="controlunit"></a>
<h2>Control Unit</h2>

<p>The control unit (CU) is a component of a computer's central processing unit (CPU) that directs the operation of the processor. It tells the computer's memory, arithmetic logic unit and input and output devices how to respond to the instructions that have been sent to the processor.</p>


<a name="randomaccessmemory"></a>
<h2>Random Access Memory</h2>

<p>Random-access memory is a form of computer memory that can be read and changed in any order, typically used to store working data and machine code. RAM allows data items to be read or written in almost the same amount of time.</p> 

<a name="opticalmemory"></a>
<h2>Optical Memory</h2>

<p>Optical storage is the storage of data on an optically readable medium. Data is recorded by making marks in a pattern that can be read back with the aid of light, usually a beam of laser light precisely focused on a spinning optical disc. An older example of optical storage that does
not require the use of computers, is microform.</p> 

<a name="magneticmemory"></a>
<h2>Magnetic Memory</h2>

<p>Magnetic memory is the main way how data is being stored on magnetic medium. It is how data is stored on devices like hard drive which is the device people use to store documents audios and videos in their computers.</p> 

<a name="flashmemory"></a>
<h2>Flash Memory</h2>

<p>Flash memory is an electronic non-volatile computer memory storage medium that can be electrically erased and reprogrammed. The two main types of flash memory are NOR flash and NAND flash, are named for the NOR and NAND logic gates. NAND flash and NOR flash use the same cell design, consisting
of floating gate MOSFETs.</p> 

<a name="logicgates"></a>
<h2>Logic Gates</h2>

<p>A logic gate is an idealized model of computation or physical electronic device implementing a Boolean function, a logical operation performed on one or more binary inputs that produces a single binary output.</p>
